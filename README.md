# My Fork Changes (IB_U_Z_Z_A_R_D)

**All credit goes to [Tophs-Overlay](https://github.com/Toph2T1/Tophs-Overlay) for the original development of the source code.**<br>

I have forked this project because the original script owner has been inactive for the past seven months and has not merged my pull requests on their GitHub repository.<br>
Since the project is open source, I am taking the initiative to continue updating it independently, as it is an excellent script.<br>

Here are the changes I have made:

- Improved code.
- Reduced code.
- Fixed the issue where "Next Host" occasionally displayed the wrong player.
- Replaced all tab characters in the source code with four spaces for consistent alignment.
- Updated the "Transition State" global to GTA Build 1.0.3258.0
- Added the "Player Talking" feature.
- Removed trailing spaces from the source code for better readability and consistency.
