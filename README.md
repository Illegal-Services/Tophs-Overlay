# PROJECT ARCHIVED / FAREWELL

On September 17, 2024, R* added the [BattleEye Anti-Cheat](https://www.battleye.com/) to GTA Online, meaning I can no longer work on this or any of my other scripts. All of my 2Take1 Mod Menu scripts will now be archived.

It's been a blast-fun, rewarding, and full of good vibes-to learn scripting for GTA 5, making my own stuff. But, yeah, it was never exactly allowed, and all good things must come to an end.

Thanks to everyone who supported my work, whether up close or from a distance. It really kept me motivated.

If you were into my GTA scripts, you might be interested in a project I'm still working on: [GTA-V-Session-Sniffer](https://github.com/Illegal-Services/GTA-V-Session-Sniffer).

  <strong>All credit goes to <a href="https://github.com/Toph2T1/Tophs-Overlay">Tophs-Overlay</a> for the original source code.</strong>
</p>

I have forked this project because the original script owner has been inactive for the past seven months and has not merged my pull requests on their GitHub repository.<br>
Since the project is open source, I am taking the initiative to continue updating it independently, as it is an excellent script.<br>

## ChangeLog:

- Improved code.
- Reduced code.
- Fixed the issue where "Next Host" occasionally displayed the wrong player.
- Replaced all tab characters in the source code with four spaces for consistent alignment.
- Updated the "Transition State" global to GTA Build 1.0.3258.0
- Added the "Player Talking" feature.
- Added missing "Cayo Perico" zone.
- Removed trailing spaces from the source code for better readability and consistency.
